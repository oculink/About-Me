## About Me

Hello! I’m **oculink** — a tech enthusiast (I guess), Linux enjoyer, and AI developer who loves building cool (and slightly unhinged) things.

I spend most of my time experimenting with **AI**, **computer vision**, **automation**, and **random coding at 4am**, especially projects that blur the line between software and personality. Right now, I’m building **Arch-chan**, a local AI inspired by Arch Linux itself — fully offline, customizable, and powered by my own hardware. I've been working on this project since 2023. And obviously it wasn't supposed to be **Arch-chan** but rather a random name. I never got to finish it early (Still struggling financially, mentality, skill).
